A simple frontend for a simple asset table with search, sort, multi-filter.
Fleshing out a skeleton for how I would build something similar.

Note that data (in `src/assets/stock-data.mock.ts`) is ChatGPT-generated. ESG scores are inspired by MSCI ESG ratings but they are in no way reflective of reality.

## Development

This is a Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind project bootstrapped from [`create-vite`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-vite).
